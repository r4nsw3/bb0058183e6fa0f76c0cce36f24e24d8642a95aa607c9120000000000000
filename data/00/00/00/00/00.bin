  |   * Unfortunately, we missed a few bugs during testing and we have      |
  |     been working hard since launch to figure out what's causing them    |
  |     and get them fixed. We appreciate your patience these past few      |
  |     weeks, and are very happy to tell you that the first patch should   |
  |     be live within the next week                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Patch 2.55.09 will resolve most of the major bugs that we have      |
  |     found and have been reported                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Patch Notes                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Hotfix for scrambled combat log has been applied. If issue          |
  |     occurs, it only lasts for a second                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Stability is improved. Crashes have significantly lower             |
  |     occurrences                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Ranged Weapons/Effects now work as intended                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * We added a feature for saving camera zoom                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Scrolling combat log is resolved                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Items properties now apply to character stats                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Island Aumaua Race now gets their additional weapon slot in         |
  |     inventory                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Regarding Save Files and the Ominous Grey Screen of Doom, we have   |
  |     good news and not so great news. The good news is that the crash    |
  |     that was deleting the save files no longer occurs. This bug was     |
  |     still present in the first patch that was submitted, and a major    |
  |     reason why we canceled that submission                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * However (as you may have noticed), we have not completely           |
  |     resolved the grey screen bug quite yet. We need a little more       |
  |     time to work out the kinks and make sure it is completely           |
  |     squashed. This does mean that if a save file has the grey screen    |
  |     issue, the file will become corrupt and unusable. It seems this     |
  |     mostly occurs after upgrading Caed Nua, so we recommend only        |
  |     upgrading what you must to advance the story                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * But fear not! The other good news is that our team is currently     |
  |     working hard to get this resolved; once we have it locked down we   |
  |     will push out another patch so you can play to your heart's         |
